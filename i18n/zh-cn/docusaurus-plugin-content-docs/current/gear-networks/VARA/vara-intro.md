**Vara Network** can be considered mostly as a test-bed for optimizations and experiments. It will have the utility of a single-chain, high-performance, lowest latency network. Once it is live, it will live forever and will never lose any user data. It will have very little governance. Gaming, payments and experimental use cases will likely be best suited for Vara.

The main features of Vara network are:

- Fastest truly decentralized L1 ever
- Testbed for new features and optimizations
- Stable and upgradable network thanks to Substrate
- Little to no governance

Many next-generation apps, like gaming and payments, require low latency execution. The Vara standalone network will provide the fastest on-ramp for these applications and will unlock new potential applications.
