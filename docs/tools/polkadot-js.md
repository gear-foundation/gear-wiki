# Connect with Polkadot extension

Polkadot{.js} App is a basic browser-based UI for interacting with a node. This application allows to access to all features available on Substrate chains (including Gear).

To manage your accounts and keys recommended use Polkadot.js plugin for security reasons. Its functions are similar to Metamask.

Let's install the extension from [here](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)

## Create Gear account

If you don't have any accounts since you just imported the Polkadot.js and didn't make an account before. Let's make one!

:::note

All substrate addresses are MultiAddress. It's important to understand that the different formats for different networks are merely different representations of the same public key in a private-public keypair generated by an address generation tool.
