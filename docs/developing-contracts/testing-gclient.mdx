# Testing with `gclient`

`gclient` is intended to be used as a tool for testing Gear programs with a real blockchain network. It allows you to send extrinsics and RPCs by connecting to the network. We recommend using `gclient` for end-to-end testing to ensure the program works as expected in the real blockchain world.

It is essential to underline that testing with `gclient` requires the running node as the second part of the test suite. The `gclient` interacts with the node over the WebSocket protocol. Depending on the purpose of testing, `gclient` can communicate with either a local or a remote node. The best choice is to use the **local node in developer mode** for initial debugging and continuous integration.

Testing with `gclient` is slower than `gtest` and produces more build artifacts, so it is better suited as the last mile in quality control. However, `gclient` gives the most accurate test results.

## Import `gclient` lib

To use the `gclient` library, you must import it into your `Cargo.toml` file in the `[dev-dependencies]` block. Also, you need to add some external crates that are used together with `gclient`:

```toml
[package]
name = "first-gear-app"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name"]
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
gstd = { git = "https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git", tag = "v1.0.2", features = ["debug"] }

[build-dependencies]
gear-wasm-builder = { git = "https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git", tag = "v1.0.2" }

[dev-dependencies]
gclient = { git = "https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git", tag = "v1.0.2" }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Running the node

The best way is to download the latest node binary for your operating system from https://get.gear.rs. Then unpack the package and run the node. Here and below, we assume the node is running in developer mode.

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="win64" label="Windows x64" className="unique-tabs" default>

```shell
curl -O https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

or

**Windows x64**: [gear-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

Unzip the downloaded package, then run:

```shell
gear.exe --dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-arm" label="MacOS ARM">

Terminal:

```shell
wget https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz && \
tar xvf gear-nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz && \
rm gear-nightly-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz
```

Run the node in development mode:

```shell
./gear --dev
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-intel" label="MacOS x64">

Terminal:

```shell
wget https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz && \
tar xvf gear-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz && \
rm gear-nightly-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz
```

Run the node in development mode:

```shell
./gear --dev
```

<TabItem value="mac-linux" label="Linux x64">

tar xvf gear-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz && \
rm gear-nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz
```

Run the node in development mode:

```shell
./gear --dev
```

</TabItem>

Open the second terminal window and run tests using `cargo` as it was described in the [previous section](/developing-contracts/testing.md#building-a-program-in-test-mode).

## Simple example

Let's add an end-to-end test to our `first-gear-app` introduced in the [Getting Started](getting-started-in-5-minutes.md#creating-your-first-gear-smart-contract) section.

Add the `tests` directory next to the `src` directory and create the `end2end.rs` file in it.

```
└── first-gear-app
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── src
    │   └── lib.rs
    └── tests
        └── end2end.rs
```

`end2end.rs`:

```rust
use gclient::{EventProcessor, GearApi, Result};

const WASM_PATH: &str = "./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/first_gear_app.opt.wasm";

#[tokio::test]
#[ignore]
async fn test_example() -> Result<()> {
    // Create API instance
    let api = GearApi::dev().await?;

    // Subscribe to events
    let mut listener = api.subscribe().await?;

    // Check that blocks are still running
    assert!(listener.blocks_running().await?);

    // Calculate gas amount needed for initialization
    let gas_info = api
        .calculate_upload_gas(
            None,
            gclient::code_from_os(WASM_PATH)?,
            vec![],
            0,
            true,
            None,
        )
        .await?;

    // Upload and init the program
    let (message_id, program_id, _hash) = api
        .upload_program_bytes_by_path(
            WASM_PATH,
            gclient::now_micros().to_le_bytes(),
            vec![],
            gas_info.min_limit,
            0,
        )
        .await?;

    assert!(listener.message_processed(message_id).await?.succeed());

    let payload = b"PING".to_vec();

    // Calculate gas amount needed for handling the message
    let gas_info = api
        .calculate_handle_gas(None, program_id, payload.clone(), 0, true, None)
        .await?;

    // Send the PING message
    let (message_id, _hash) = api
        .send_message_bytes(program_id, payload, gas_info.min_limit, 0)
        .await?;

    assert!(listener.message_processed(message_id).await?.succeed());

    Ok(())
}
```

Run the following command and wait for all tests to be green:

```shell
cargo test --release -- --include-ignored
```

It's recommended to mark with the `#[ignore]` attribute tests with `gclient` to separate their slow execution from the rest. To execute ignored tests with Cargo, add the `--include-ignored` flag after a double dash (`--`) as shown above.

Let's explore what we've done in the test function above.

Firstly, we instantiate the API that allows interaction with the node by calling correspondent extrinsics. Then we create an event listener, as getting the feedback from the node is possible only by subscribing to events. We use the API instance both for invoking RPC calls (e.g., calculating the gas amount needed for processing) and sending extrinsics (e.g., uploading the program and sending a message). Events listener allows us to get the result of operation.
