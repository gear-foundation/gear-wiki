# Gear Multiple Token

## Introduction

A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).

The idea is simple and seeks to create a smart contract interface that can represent and control any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. In this way, the GMT token can do the same functions as a GFT and GNFT token, and even both at the same time. Can be considered as analog of ERC-1155.

## Interface

### Events

```rust
// `TransferSingle` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning
TransferSingle {
    operator: ActorId,
    from: ActorId,
    to: ActorId,
    id: u128,
    amount: u128,
}

// `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning
TransferBatch {
    operator: ActorId,
    from: ActorId,
    to: ActorId,
    ids: Vec<u128>,
    values: Vec<u128>,
}

// MUST emit when approval for a second party/operator address to manage all tokens for an owner address is enabled or disabled (absence of an event assumes disabled)
ApprovalForAll {
    owner: ActorId,
    operator: ActorId,
    approved: bool,
}
```

### Functions

```rust
// Get the balance of an account's tokens
fn balance_of(&self, account: &ActorId, id: &u128) -> u128;

// Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
fn balance_of_batch(&self, accounts: &[ActorId], ids: &[u128]) -> Vec<BalanceOfBatchReply>;

// Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens, and MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event
fn set_approval_for_all(&mut self, operator: &ActorId, approved: bool);

// Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner
fn is_approved_for_all(&mut self, account: &ActorId, operator: &ActorId) -> &bool;

// Transfers amount of tokens from address to other address, and MUST emit the TransferSingle event
fn safe_transfer_from(&mut self, from: &ActorId, to: &ActorId, id: &u128, amount: u128);

// Transfers  multiple type amount of tokens from address to other address, and MUST emit the TransferBatch event
fn safe_batch_transfer_from(&mut self, from: &ActorId, to: &ActorId, ids: &[u128], amounts: &[u128]);
```

### Init Config

```rust
pub struct InitConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub base_uri: String,
}
```

### `Action` Structure

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Decode, Encode, TypeInfo)]
pub enum Action {
    Mint(ActorId, u128, u128),
    BalanceOf(ActorId, u128),
    BalanceOfBatch(Vec<ActorId>, Vec<u128>),
    MintBatch(ActorId, Vec<u128>, Vec<u128>),
    SafeTransferFrom(ActorId, ActorId, u128, u128),
    SafeBatchTransferFrom(ActorId, ActorId, Vec<u128>, Vec<u128>),
    SetApprovalForAll(ActorId, bool),
    IsApprovedForAll(ActorId, ActorId),
    BurnBatch(Vec<u128>, Vec<u128>),
    OwnerOf(u128),
    OwnerOfBatch(Vec<u128>),
}
```

### `Event` Structure

```rust
pub enum Event {
    TransferSingle(TransferSingleReply),
    Balance(u128),
    BalanceOfBatch(Vec<BalanceOfBatchReply>),
    MintOfBatch(Vec<BalanceOfBatchReply>),
    TransferBatch {
        operator: ActorId,
        from: ActorId,
        to: ActorId,
        ids: Vec<u128>,
        values: Vec<u128>,
    },
    ApprovalForAll {
        owner: ActorId,
        operator: ActorId,
        approved: bool,
    },
}

#[derive(Debug, Decode, Encode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct TransferSingleReply {
    pub operator: ActorId,
    pub from: ActorId,
    pub to: ActorId,
    pub id: u128,
    pub amount: u128,
}

#[derive(Debug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct BalanceOfBatchReply {
    pub account: ActorId,
    pub id: u128,
    pub amount: u128,
}
```
