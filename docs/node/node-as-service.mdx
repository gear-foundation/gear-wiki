# Сonfiguring a node as a Linux service

## Prerequisites

You need to download or compile the gear-node executable file for your OS. [See more](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/node/setting-up#install-with-pre-build-binary)

## Configuration

To run the Gear node as one of the Linux services, you need to configure the systemd file:

From `root` directory:

```sh
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo nano gear-node.service
```

Configure and save:

```
[Unit]
Description=Gear Node
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/
ExecStart=/root/gear-node --name 'NODE_NAME' --telemetry-url 'ws://telemetry-backend-shard.gear-tech.io:32001/submit 0'
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=10000

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::note
Declaration `ExecStart` points to the location of the gear-node binary file. In this case, it is in `root` directory.
With -- additional launch parameters are indicated, but not mandatory.
:::

That’s it. We can now start the service.

## Starting the node

Run to start the service:

```sh
sudo systemctl start gear-node
```

Automatically get it to start on boot:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable gear-node
```

How to check status of gear-node service?

```sh
sudo systemctl status gear-node
```

## Checking logs

You may see the service logs by running the following command:

```sh
journalctl -u gear-node
```

Use navigation keys to browse the logs and `q` key to exit.

You may see the last 50 lines of logs by adding `-n 50` parameter:

```sh
journalctl -u gear-node -n 50
```

Add `-f` parameter to see the last lines of logs in continuous mode (press Ctrl+C to exit):

```sh
journalctl -u gear-node -fn 50
```
