# Сonfiguring a node as a Linux service

## Prerequisites

You need to download or compile the gear-node executable file for your OS. [See more](https://wiki.gear-tech.io/node/setting-up#install-with-pre-build-binary) 

To run the Gear node as one of the Linux services, you need to configure the systemd file:

From `root` directory:

```sh
cd /etc/systemd/system
touch gear-node.service 
sudo nano gear-node.service
```

Configure and save:

```
[Unit] 
Description=Gear Node 
After=network.target 

[Service] 
Type=simple 
User=root 
WorkingDirectory=/root/ 
ExecStart=/root/gear-node \
    --telemetry-url 'ws://telemetry-backend-shard.gear-tech.io:32001/submit 0' \
    --name 'NODE_NAME' 
Restart=always 
RestartSec=3 
LimitNOFILE=10000
 
[Install] 
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::note
Declaration `ExecStart` points to the location of the gear-node binary file. In this case, it is in `root` directory.
With -- additional launch parameters are indicated, but not mandatory.
:::

That’s it. We can now start the service:

```sh
systemctl start gear-node
```

Automatically get it to start on boot:

```sh
systemctl enable gear-node
```

## How to check status of gear-node service?

```sh
systemctl status gear-node
```
