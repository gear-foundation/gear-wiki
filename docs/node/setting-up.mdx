# Setting Up Gear Node

## Introduction

This guide covers the steps required to install and run the Gear node.

There are two ways to get started with the Gear node. First, you can download a pre-built binary file and run it, or second, you can compile the binary file and configure it by yourself. Using a ready-made build is a quick and convenient way to get started as you can skip the installation of Rust and all its dependencies and you can also skip the node compiling process. On the other hand, if you decide that you want to go through the process of creating your development node, it may take about twenty minutes or more depending on your hardware.

### System requirements:

Gear node doesn't have any special hardware requirements excepting at least 64 Gbytes of free space on the SSD disk.

:::

## Install with pre-build binary

Depending on your OS you need to download the last release build of Gear node from https://get.gear.rs:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux x86-64" className="unique-tabs" default>

Terminal:

```bash
curl https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz | tar xJ
```

or

**Linux x86-64**: [gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz)

Run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 1.2.1-a218853
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac-arm" label="macOS ARM">

Terminal:

```bash
curl https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz | tar xJ
```

or

**macOS ARM**: [gear-v1.2.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.xz)

You can try to run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 1.2.1-a218853
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-intel" label="macOS x86-64">

Terminal:

```bash
curl https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz | tar xJ
```

or

**macOS x86-64**: [gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.xz)

You can try to run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 1.2.1-a218853
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="win64" label="Windows x86-64">

Terminal:

```bash
curl -O https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip
```

or

**Windows x86-64**: [gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip](https://get.gear.rs/gear-v1.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

Unzip the downloaded package then you can try to run the node:

```
❯ gear.exe --version
gear.exe 1.2.1-a218853
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

:::info

You can use [nightly builds](https://get.gear.rs/#gear-nightly) if you want the latest features.

:::

## Compile Gear node by yourself

Compiling the build will take some time and requires the installation of some dependencies.

:::warning Note

Windows users may encounter some problems related to the installation of Rust components and dependencies.
It is highly recommended to use Linux or macOS for compiling Gear node and smart-contracts.

:::

### Prerequisites

Linux users should generally install `GCC` and `Clang`, according to their distribution’s documentation. Also, one should install `binaryen` toolset that contains required `wasm-opt` tool.

For example, on Ubuntu use:

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang build-essential binaryen cmake protobuf-compiler
```

On macOS, you can get a compiler toolset and `binaryen` by running:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install binaryen
```

### Install Rust:

If you already have Rust installed, you can skip this step.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And then you should reboot your terminal.

### Install Wasm Toolchains:

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Clone Gear repo

```
git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git
cd gear
# Checkout to the latest release tag
git checkout v1.2.1 -b release-1.2.1
```

:::info

If you need to use the latest or experimental Gear functions, you should compile the node from `master` branch. It is the default branch after clone, but you can switch back to the `master` branch using a command:

```bash
git checkout master
```

:::

### Compile

```bash
cargo build -p gear-cli --release
```

or

```bash
make node-release
```

:::note

You can find the final build at the following location: `gear/target/release/gear`

Go to:

```bash
cd target/release
```

:::

## Run Gear Node

:::info

It doesn't matter if you downloaded the prebuild binary or built it yourself. Being in the directory where the gear node is installed to run it without special arguments to get a node connected to the testnet:

:::

```bash
./gear
```

To run Gear node in dev mode use the following command:

```bash
./gear --dev
```

## Command Flags and Options

```code
gear [subcommand] [options]
```

- `--chain=testnet`

  Connect the node to the test network (default option).

- `--chain=vara`

  Connect the node to the Vara network.

- `--dev`

  Run a local node in development mode for testing purposes. This node will not be connected to any external network and will store the state in temporary storage.

- `purge-chain`

  Remove storage of the selected chain type. Needs to specify the chain connection type `--chain=testnet`, `--chain=vara`, or `--dev`.

- `help`, `--help`

  Print the available subcommands/options or the help of the given subcommand.

## Special environment variables

To run Gear node with logs from contracts use:

```code
RUST_LOG="gwasm=debug" gear [subcommand] [options]
```
