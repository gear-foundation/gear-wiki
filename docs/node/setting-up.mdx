# Setting Up Gear Node

## Introduction

This guide covers the steps required to install and run the Gear node.

There are two ways to get started with the Gear node. First, you can download a pre-built binary file and run it, or second, you can compile the binary file and configure it by yourself. Using a ready-made build is a quick and convenient way to get started as you can skip the installation of Rust and all its dependencies and you can also skip the node compiling process. On the other hand, if you decide that you want to go through the process of creating your development node, it may take about twenty minutes or more depending on your hardware.

### System requirements:

Gear node doesn't have any special hardware requirements excepting at least 64 Gbytes of free space on the SSD disk.

## Install with pre-build binary

Depending on your OS you need to download nightly build of Gear node:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="win64" label="Windows x64" className="unique-tabs" default>

Terminal:

```bash
curl -O https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip
```

or

**Windows x64**: [gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-windows-x86_64.zip)

Unzip the downloaded package then you can try to run the node:

```
❯ gear.exe --version
gear.exe 0.1.0-hashcode
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-arm" label="MacOS ARM">

Terminal:

```bash
wget https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-m.tar.gz && \
tar xvf gear-nightly-macos-m.tar.gz && \
rm gear-nightly-macos-m.tar.gz
```

or

**macOS M1/M2**: [gear-nightly-macos-m.tar.gz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-m.tar.gz)

You can try to run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 0.1.0-hashcode
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac-intel" label="MacOS x64">

Terminal:

```bash
wget https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz && \
tar xvf gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz && \
rm gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
```

or

**macOS Intel x64**: [gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-macos-x86_64.tar.gz)

You can try to run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 0.1.0-hashcode
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac-linux" label="Linux x64">

Terminal:

```bash
wget https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz && \
tar xvf gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz && \
rm gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
```

or

**Linux x64**: [gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz](https://get.gear.rs/gear-nightly-linux-x86_64.tar.xz)

You can try to run the node:

```
❯ ./gear --version
gear 0.1.0-hashcode
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Compile Gear node by yourself

Compiling the build will take some time and requires the installation of some dependencies:

### Prerequisites

Linux users should generally install `GCC` and `Clang`, according to their distribution’s documentation. Also, one should install `binaryen` toolset that contains required `wasm-opt` tool.

For example, on Ubuntu use:

```bash
sudo apt install -y clang build-essential binaryen cmake protobuf-compiler
```

On macOS, you can get a compiler toolset and `binaryen` by running:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install binaryen
```

### Install Rust:

If you already have Rust installed, you can skip this step.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And then you should reboot your terminal.

### Install Wasm Toolchains:

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Clone Gear repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git
cd gear

## Optional
## To use the stable version of gear-node, we recommend:

git checkout stable
```

### Compile

```bash
cargo build -p gear-cli --release
```

or

```bash
make node-release
```

:::note

You can find the final build at the following location: `gear/target/release/gear`

Go to:

```bash
cd target/release
```

:::

## Run Gear Node

:::info

It doesn't matter if you downloaded the prebuild binary or built it yourself. Being in the directory where the gear node is installed to run it without special arguments to get a node connected to the testnet:

:::

```bash
./gear
```

To run Gear node in dev mode use the following command:

```bash
./gear --dev --tmp
```

## Command Flags and Options

```code
gear [subcommand] [options]
```

- `--staging`

  Connect the node to Gear testnet (default option).

- `--dev`

  Run standalone node of Gear network.

- `--tmp`

  Run node with a temporary storage. A temporary directory will be created to store the configuration and will be deleted at the end of the process.

- `purge-chain`

  Remove storage of the selected chain type. Needs to specify the chain connection type `--staging` or `--dev`

- `help`, `--help`

  Print the available subcommands/options or the help of the given subcommand.

## Special environment variables

To run Gear node with logs from contracts use:

```code
RUST_LOG="gwasm=debug" gear [subcommand] [options]
```
