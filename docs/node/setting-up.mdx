# Setting Up Gear Node

## Introduction

This guide covers the steps required to install and run the Gear node.

There are two ways to get started with the Gear node. First, you can download a pre-built binary file and run it, or second, you can compile the binary file and configure it by yourself. Using a ready-made build is a quick and convenient way to get started as you can skip the installation of Rust and all its dependencies and you can also skip the node compiling process. On the other hand, if you decide that you want to go through the process of creating your development node, it may take about twenty minutes or more depending on your hardware.

## Install with pre-build binary

Depending on your OS you need to download nightly build of Gear node:

tar xvf gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz && \
rm gear-nightly-macos-m1.tar.gz && \
chmod +x gear-node
```

or

## Compile Gear node by yourself

Compiling the build will take some time and requires the installation of some dependencies:

### Install Rust:

If you already have Rust installed, you can skip this step.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And then you should reboot your terminal.

### Install WASM Toolchains:

```bash
rustup toolchain add nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

### Clone Gear repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gear-tech/gear.git
cd gear
```

### Compile

```bash
cargo build -p gear-node --release
```

or

```bash
make node-release
```

:::note

You can find the final build in directory `/gear/target/release/gear-node`

Go to:

```bash
cd target/release
```

## Run Gear Node

:::info

It doesn't matter if you downloaded the prebuild biniery or built it yourself. Being in the directory where the gear node is installed to run it without special arguments to get a node connected to the testnet:

:::

```bash
gear-node --staging
```

To run Gear node in dev mode use the following command:

```bash
gear-node --dev --tmp
```

## Comands Flags and Options

```code
gear-node [flags] [options]
```

`--staging`

Connect the node to Gear testnet.

`--dev`

Run standalone node of Gear network.

`--tmp`

Run node with a temporary storage. A temporary directory will be created to store the configuration and will be deleted at the end of the process.

`purge-chain`

Remove storage of the selected chain type. Needs to specify the chain connection type `--staging` or `--dev`

`--help`

For more information

## Special environment variables

To run Gear node with logs from contracts use:

```code
RUST_LOG="gwasm=debug" gear-node [flags]
```
