# What are dApps?

Decentralized Applications, or dApps, are applications that offer similar functionality to traditional applications but the main difference is that they are run on decentralized peer-to-peer networks, such as blockchains. Decentralized applications offer the services that make up the Web3 revolution.

Because dApps are decentralized, there isn’t a single entity that has control over the application. Instead these applications are open-source and their data is publicly available. DApps use cryptographic tokens to help keep the network secure and they are totally permissionless, which means that anyone, anywhere can interact with them.

What makes dApps so innovative apart from their inclusive nature and exceptionally low barrier to entry is that they are censorship-resistant. This means that because there is no single point of failure, it’s very difficult to restrict access to a decentralized application. This lack of a single point of failure also means that dApps are very difficult to attack and that there is often zero downtime.

In most cases, to interact with a dApp, users must possess that application's native cryptocurrency.
