Substrate is a modular framework that enables the creation of unique blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components.

It`s easy to understand the functions of Substrate by its name. Substrate is a template that provides extensive functionality out-of-the-box, including consensus mechanisms, governance features, WASM, and more. Substrate features are the following:

- Forkless Update
- Built-in Coordination
- Cross-Language Support with WebAssembly
- Light-Client Friendly
