# Gear IDEA online

Gear IDEA is a convenient tool thatâ€™s purpose is to familiarize users with the Gear platform. It provides smart-contract developers with the easiest and fastest way to write, compile, test and upload smart-contracts to a test network directly in their browser without additional configuration.

This is the demo application that implements all of the possibilities of interaction with smart-contracts in Gear, that also manages accounts, balances, events and more.

You can start experimenting right now on https://idea.gear-tech.io/.
