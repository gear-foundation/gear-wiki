# WebAssembly

WebAssembly VM (or Wasm) is proven to be faster than any alternatives because of technology peculiarities. The use of WebAssembly lets GEARâ€™s smart contracts compile directly into machine code and run at native speeds. A higher speed means lower transaction costs and higher efficiency.

Gear uses WebAssembly under the hood. Any Gear program is in WebAssembly format. In Gear context, any smart-contract is a WebAssembly program.

WebAssembly has the following advantages:

 - Native speed. As it translates to actual hardware instructions.
 - Portable. It can run on any actual hardware.
 - Safe. Properly validated WebAssembly program cannot leave sandbox (guaranteed by specification).
 
WebAssembly is a global industrial technology, remarkable for many reasons:

 - It has been designed and implemented in collaboration between all major competitors in its space.
 - It has been designed and released along with a complete mathematical, machine-verified formalisation.
