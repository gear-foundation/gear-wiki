# Substrate

Substrate is a modular framework that enables the creation of custom-built unique blockchains by composing custom or pre-built components with networking, consensus mechanism, core functionality, security and governance features out of the box.

Using a Substrate framework, the creation of different blockchains for specific applications is simplified. Substrate provides extensive functionality out-of-the-box and allows developers to focus on creating a custom engine on top of the protocol. This covers the most desired requirements for enterprise-ready decentralized projects.

It is an important component of the Polkadot network and it allows every team creating a new blockchain not to waste efforts for implementing the code for networking, consensus and other essential components from scratch. Refer to the [Substrate Documentation](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/) for more details.

Polkadot is a next-generation Layer-0 blockchain protocol intended to unite multiple purpose-built blockchains, allowing them to operate seamlessly together at scale. The critical aspect of the Polkadot network is its ability to route arbitrary messages between chains. These messages enable negotiation channels between two parachains and allow sending asynchronous messages through it.

It's easy to understand the functions of Substrate by its name. The main Substrate features are the following:
- Forkless Update
- Built-in Coordination
- Cross-Language Support with WebAssembly
- Light-Client Friendly
- Deterministic Finality
- Seamless Integration

Substrate enables the Gear team to significantly reduce development time and focus on developing the main Gear Protocol components. Rust guarantees security and high performance.

Using Substrate allows for a quick connection for Gear Network instances as a parachains into the Polkadot & Kusama networks. The Polkadot Relay Chain and the Gear Network ultimately speak the same language - asynchronous messages. Gearâ€™s unique asynchronous messaging architecture allows the Gear Network to be an effective and easy-to-use parachain of Polkadot network.

But even with Substrate, launching a new blockchain remains relatively expensive and time consuming. But the Gear Protocol allows dApp developers to focus on their projects rather than building and operating an entirely new blockchain from scratch.
