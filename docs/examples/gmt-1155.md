# Gear Multiple Token (gMT)

## Introduction

A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).

The idea is simple and seeks to create a smart contract interface that can represent and control any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. In this way, the gMT token can do the same functions as gFT and gNFT token, and even both at the same time. Can be considered as analog of [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155).

This article explains the programming interface, data structure, basic functions and explains their purpose. It can be used as is or modified to suit your own scenarios. Anyone can easily create their own application and run it on the Gear Network. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/contracts/sharded-multi-token).

## Architecture

Because of the use of an asynchronous model and actor model, the implementation architecture requires splitting the contract into several parts, similar to sharded-fungible-token(gFT). This is necessary to achieve idempotency and state synchronization.

### The storage contract(mt-storage)

Saves the user's balances and approvals. Contains commands to manipulate these fields. Also `mt-logic` is responsible for creating new associated `mt-storage` - this provides scalability and greatly increases memory limits.

#### The contract state:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Clone, Debug, TypeInfo)]
pub struct MTStorageState {
    /// Address of multitoken logic contract.
    pub mt_logic_id: ActorId,
    /// Stores abstract transactions statuses.
    pub transaction_status: Vec<(H256, bool)>,
    /// Mapping with balances: `TokenId` -> `ActorId` -> `u128`.
    pub balances: Vec<(TokenId, Vec<(ActorId, u128)>)>,
    /// Mapping with approvals: `ActorId` -> `ActorId` -> `bool`.
    pub approvals: Vec<(ActorId, Vec<(ActorId, bool)>)>,
}
```

#### The contract actions:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Debug, Clone, TypeInfo)]
pub enum MTStorageAction {
    /// Returns `account` token balance.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - `token_id` must exist in [`MTStorageState`] state, in `balances` field.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Balance`].
    GetBalance {
        /// Token ID to get the balance.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// Specifies the account whose balance you want to find out.
        account: ActorId,
    },
    /// Returns status approval for `approval_target` from `account`.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - `account` must exist in [`MTStorageState`] state, in `approvals` field.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Approval`].
    GetApproval {
        /// An account that provides approval.
        account: ActorId,
        /// An account that is being verified.
        approval_target: ActorId,
    },
    /// Transfer `amount` of `token_id` tokens from `sender` to `recipient`.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - [`msg::source()`](gstd::msg::source) must be a multitoken logic contract.
    /// - `sender` must be equal to `msg_source` or `msg_source` must be approved by `sender`.
    /// - `sender` must have enough `amount` of `token_id` tokens.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Ok`].
    Transfer {
        /// Unique transfer transaction hash.
        transaction_hash: H256,
        /// Identifier of the token with which transfer will be performed.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// The actual account that made the transfer (initiator).
        msg_source: ActorId,
        /// Account from which tokens will be transferred.
        sender: ActorId,
        /// Transfer recipient.
        recipient: ActorId,
        /// Tokens amount for transfer.
        amount: u128,
    },
    /// Gives `approve` to `account` for various token-related operations.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - [`msg::source()`](gstd::msg::source) must be a multitoken logic contract.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Ok`].
    Approve {
        /// Unique approve transaction hash.
        transaction_hash: H256,
        /// The actual account that made the approve (initiator).
        msg_source: ActorId,
        /// Account to which access is granted.
        account: ActorId,
        /// Approve flag.
        approve: bool,
    },
    /// Deletes the stored transaction entity with its status by unique hash.
    ClearTransaction(H256),
    /// Increase `account` balance of `token_id` tokens.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - [`msg::source()`](gstd::msg::source) must be a multitoken logic contract.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Ok`].
    IncreaseBalance {
        /// Unique operation transaction hash.
        transaction_hash: H256,
        /// Identifier of the token with which increase balance will be performed.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// An account that needs to increase its balance.
        account: ActorId,
        /// Number of tokens by which the balance will be increased.
        amount: u128,
    },
    /// Decrease `account` balance of `token_id` tokens.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - [`msg::source()`](gstd::msg::source) must be multitoken logic contract.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTStorageEvent::Ok`].
    DecreaseBalance {
        /// Unique operation transaction hash.
        transaction_hash: H256,
        /// Identifier of the token with which decrease balance will be performed.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// The actual account that made the decrease operation (initiator).
        msg_source: ActorId,
        /// An account that needs to decrease its balance.
        account: ActorId,
        /// Number of tokens by which the balance will be decreased.
        amount: u128,
    },
}
```

#### The contract events:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, Clone, Debug, TypeInfo)]
pub enum MTStorageEvent {
    /// Should be returned from any mutable operation from [`MTStorageAction`], if the operation is completed without errors.
    Ok,
    /// Should be returned from any mutable operation from [`MTStorageAction`], if the operation is completed with errors.
    Err,
    /// Should be returned from [`MTStorageAction::GetBalance`].
    Balance(u128),
    /// Should be returned from [`MTStorageAction::GetApproval`].
    Approval(bool),
}
```

### The logic contract(mt-logic)

Provides basic business logic for multitoken implementation and has the ability to manage `mt-storage` contract. It is essentially a `controller`. The processing of token indices is implemented using bit masks - this is the preferred [implementation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155#split-id-bits).

#### The contract state:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, Clone)]
pub struct MTLogicState {
    /// Multitoken logic admin address.
    pub admin: ActorId,
    /// Multitoken main contract address.
    pub mtoken_id: ActorId,
    /// Stores abstract transactions statuses.
    pub transaction_status: Vec<(H256, TransactionStatus)>,
    /// Stores instructions which may contain a few multitoken operations.
    pub instructions: Vec<(H256, (Instruction, Instruction))>,
    /// Unique hash-identifier of storage contract code.
    pub storage_code_hash: H256,
    /// Mapping with specific id to multitoken storage impl: `String` -> `ActorId`(dedicated storage contract).
    pub id_to_storage: Vec<(String, ActorId)>,
    /// Global token nonce(counter).
    pub token_nonce: TokenId,
    /// Mapping with token URIs: `token_id` -> `String`(URI).
    pub token_uris: Vec<(TokenId, String)>,
    /// Mapping with tokens total supply: `token_id` -> `u128`.
    pub token_total_supply: Vec<(TokenId, u128)>,
    /// Mapping with token creators: `token_id` -> `ActorId`.
    pub token_creators: Vec<(TokenId, ActorId)>,
}
```

#### The contract actions:

```rust

    /// Handles high-level token operations.
    Message {
        /// Unique operation transaction hash.

        payload: Vec<u8>,
    },
    /// Returns `account` token balance.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - `token_id` must exist in [`MTStorageState`](mt_storage_io::MTStorageState) state, in `balances` field.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTLogicEvent::Balance`].
    GetBalance {
        /// Token ID to get the balance.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// Specifies the account whose balance you want to find out.
        account: ActorId,
    },
    /// Returns status approval for `approval_target` from `account`.
    ///
    /// # Requirements
    /// - `account` must exists in [`MTStorageState`](mt_storage_io::MTStorageState) state, in `approvals` field.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTLogicEvent::Approval`].
    GetApproval {
        /// An account that provides approval.
        account: ActorId,
        /// An account that is being verified.
        approval_target: ActorId,
    },
    /// Deletes the stored transaction entity with its status by unique hash.
    Clear(H256),
    /// Updates unique hash-identifier of storage contract code.
    UpdateStorageCodeHash(H256),
    /// Unimplemented.
    MigrateStorages,
}
```

#### The contract events:

```rust

    /// Should be returned from [`MTLogicAction::Message`], if the operation is completed without errors.
    Ok,
    /// Should be returned from [`MTLogicAction::Message`], if the operation is completed with errors.
    Err,
    /// Should be returned from [`MTLogicAction::GetBalance`].
    Balance(u128),
    /// Should be returned from [`MTLogicAction::GetApproval`].
    Approval(bool),
}
```

#### The contract multitoken actions:

```rust

    /// Transfer `amount` of `token_id` tokens from `sender` to `recipient`.
    ///

        uri: String,
        /// Indicates if this token is nft.

```

#### The contract initializer:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct InitMTLogic {
    /// Has ability to update storage code hash.
    pub admin: ActorId,
    /// Unique hash-identifier of storage contract code.
    pub storage_code_hash: H256,
}
```

### The main contract(mt-main)

This part acts as an updatable proxy, but moreover tracks incoming transactions to achieve idempotency, and provides abstractions to handle `mt-logic`.

#### The contract state:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, Clone)]
pub struct MTokenState {
    /// Multitoken main contract admin.
    pub admin: ActorId,
    /// Address of multitoken logic contract.
    pub mt_logic_id: ActorId,
    /// Stores abstract transactions statuses.
    pub transactions: Vec<(H256, TransactionStatus)>,
}
```

#### The contract actions:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, Debug)]
pub enum MTokenAction {
    /// Handles high-level token operations.
    Message {
        /// Operation transaction id(each new abstract-transaction must increase).
        transaction_id: u64,
        /// Encoded high-level [`Action`](mt_logic_io::Action) operation.
        payload: Vec<u8>,
    },
    /// Updates unique hash-identifier or multitoken storage and logic contract code.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTokenEvent::Ok`].
    UpdateLogicContract {
        /// Unique hash-identifier of logic contract code.
        mt_logic_code_hash: H256,
        /// Unique hash-identifier of storage contract code.
        storage_code_hash: H256,
    },
    /// Returns `account` token balance.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTokenEvent::Balance`].
    GetBalance {
        /// Token ID to get the balance.
        token_id: TokenId,
        /// Specifies the account whose balance you want to find out.
        account: ActorId,
    },
    /// Returns status approval for `approval_target` from `account`.
    ///
    /// On success, replies with [`MTokenEvent::Approval`].
    GetApproval {
        /// An account that provides approval.
        account: ActorId,
        /// An account that is being verified.
        approval_target: ActorId,
    },
    /// Deletes the stored transaction entity with its status by unique hash.
    Clear(H256),
    /// Unimplemented.
    MigrateStorageAddresses,
}
```

#### The contract events:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Clone, Copy)]
pub enum MTokenEvent {
    /// Should be returned from [`MTokenAction::Message`], if the operation is completed without errors.
    Ok,
    /// Should be returned from [`MTokenAction::Message`], if the operation is completed with errors.
    Err,
    /// Should be returned from [`MTokenAction::GetBalance`].
    Balance(u128),
    /// Should be returned from [`MTokenAction::GetApproval`].
    Approval(bool),
}
```

#### The contract transactions status entity:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo, Copy, Clone, Debug)]
pub enum TransactionStatus {
    /// Transaction is in progress.
    InProgress,
    /// Transaction completed successfully.
    Success,
    /// Transaction failed.
    Failure,
}
```

#### The contract initializer:

```rust
#[derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
pub struct InitMToken {
    /// Unique hash-identifier of storage contract code.
    pub storage_code_hash: H256,
    /// Unique hash-identifier of logic contract code.
    pub mt_logic_code_hash: H256,
}
```

## Conclusion

Gear provides a reusable library with core functionality for the gMT protocol. By using object composition, that library can be utilized within a custom gMT/MTK contract implementation in order to minimize duplication of community available code.

See also an example of the smart contract testing implementation based on `gtest` and `gclient`: [`sharded-multi-token/tests`](https://github.com/gear-foundation/dapps/tree/master/contracts/sharded-multi-token/tests).
