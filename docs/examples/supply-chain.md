# Supply chain

In logistics, a supply chain is a system for tracking and delivering to an end consumer various items. As a rule, such systems can't work without a lot of paperwork and other layers of bureaucracy. All of this costs a lot of time and money and increases the likelihood of an accidental error or, worst of all, a fraud. With the help of smart contract and blockchain technologies, it is possible to eliminate these problems by making a supply chain more efficient, reliable and transparent.

- [Supply chain contract](https://github.com/gear-dapps/supply-chain).
- [Supply chain UI](https://github.com/gear-dapps/supply-chain/tree/master/frontend).

## How to run

### ‚öíÔ∏è Build programs

Upload Supply chain contract requires build two auxiliary contracts:

- Build [NFT contract](https://github.com/gear-dapps/non-fungible-token/) as described in `README.md`
- Build [Sharded FT contract](https://github.com/gear-dapps/sharded-fungible-token/) as described in `README.md`
- Build [Supply Chain contract](https://github.com/gear-dapps/supply-chain) as described in `README.md`

### üèóÔ∏è Upload programs

You can deploy a program using [idea.gear-tech.io](https://idea.gear-tech.io/). In the network selector choose `Staging Testnet` or `Development` (in this case, you should have a local node running).

*** Non-Fungible Token ***

1. Upload program `nft.opt.wasm` from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`
2. Upload metadata file `meta.txt`
3. Specify `init payload` and calculate gas!

:::info
Init payload:
- name `Str` - NFT collection name
- symbol `Str` - NFT collection symbol
- base_uri `Str` - NFT collection base URI
- royalties `Option<Royalties>` - Optional param to specify accounts to pay royalties
:::

*** Sharded Fungible Token ***

1. Upload code `ft_logic.opt.wasm` from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`
2. Upload code `ft_storage.opt.wasm` from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`
3. Upload program `ft_main.opt.wasm` from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`
4. Upload metadata file `meta.txt`
5. Specify `init payload` and calculate gas!

:::info
InitFToken payload:
- storage_code_hash (H256) - storage code ID
- ft_logic_code_hash (H256) - logic code ID
:::

*** Supply Chain ***

1. Upload code `supply_chain.opt.wasm` from `/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`

### üñ•Ô∏è Run UI

1. Install packages

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Configure .evn file. Specify network address and program ID like in the example below:

For proper application functioning, one needs to adjust an environment variable parameters. An example is available [here](https://github.com/gear-dapps/supply-chain/blob/master/frontend/.env.example).

```sh
REACT_APP_NODE_ADDRESS=wss://rpc-node.gear-tech.io
REACT_APP_CODE_ADDRESS=0x7141c1f9eb7c48063fc7d3a00e7ef157c4a95a83d656efaee910104d429b0de9
```

3. Run app

```sh
yarn start
```

## Logic

* Each newly produced item gets the NFT (in Gear's context - [Gear non-fungible token (gNFT)](gnft-721.md) and its ID equals an ID of the item. Then, as an item moves along a supply chain, an item's NFT transfers between a supply chain program, item's producer, and future distributor, retailer and end consumer.
* Anyone who knows an item's ID can get item info.
* Sale, purchase, delivery is made in [Gear fungible tokens (gFT)](gft-20.md).

Item info has the following struct:
```rust
pub struct ItemInfo {
    /// Item‚Äôs producer [`ActorId`].
    pub producer: ActorId,
    /// [`ActorId`] of an item‚Äôs current or past distributor (depends on item‚Äôs
    /// `state`). If it equals [`ActorId::zero()`], then it means that an item
    /// has never had a distributor.
    pub distributor: ActorId,
    /// [`ActorId`] of an item‚Äôs current or past retailer (depends on item‚Äôs
    /// `state`). If it equals [`ActorId::zero()`], then it means that an item
    /// has never had a retailer.
    pub retailer: ActorId,

    pub state: ItemState,
    /// An item‚Äôs price. If it equals 0, then, depending on item‚Äôs `state`, an
    /// item is sold for free or has never been put up for sale.
    pub price: u128,
    /// Milliseconds during which a current seller should deliver an item.
    pub delivery_time: u64,
}
```

And `ItemState` has the following struct and inner enums:
```rust
pub struct ItemState {
    pub state: ItemEventState,
    pub by: Role,
}

pub enum ItemEventState {
    Produced,
    Purchased,
    Received,
    Processed,
    Packaged,
    ForSale,
    Approved,
    Shipped,
}

pub enum Role {
    Producer,
    Distributor,
    Retailer,
    Consumer,
}
```

### Item route

1. The item is produced with `ProducerAction::Produce`.
1. The item is put up for sale with `ProducerAction::PutUpForSale`.
1. The item is purchased with `DistributorAction::Purchase`.
1. The purchase is approved or not with `ProducerAction::Approve`. In the latter case the item returns on the **2** step.
1. The item is shipped with `ProducerAction::Ship`.
1. The item is received with `DistributorAction::Receive`.
1. The item is processed with `DistributorAction::Process`.
1. The item is packaged with `DistributorAction::Package`.
1. The item is put up for sale with `DistributorAction::PutUpForSale`.
1. The item is purchased with `RetailerAction::Purchase`.
1. The purchase is approved or not with `DistributorAction::Approve`. In the latter case the item returns on the **9** step.
1. The item is shipped with `DistributorAction::Ship`.
1. The item is received with `RetailerAction::Receive`.
1. The item is put up for sale with `RetailerAction::PutUpForSale`.
1. The item is purchased with `ConsumerAction::Purchase`.

The end!

### Initialization

```rust

/// # Requirements
/// - Each [`ActorId`] of `producers`, `distributors`, and `retailers` mustn't
/// equal [`ActorId::zero()`].

### Program metadata and state
Metadata interface description:

```rust
pub struct ContractMetadata;

impl Metadata for ContractMetadata {
    type Init = InOut<Initialize, Result<(), Error>>;
    type Handle = InOut<Action, Result<Event, Error>>;
    type Reply = ();
    type Others = ();
    type Signal = ();
    type State = State;
}
```
To display the full contract state information, the `state()` function is used:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
extern "C" fn state() {
    reply(common_state())
        .expect("Failed to encode or reply with `<ContractMetadata as Metadata>::State` from `state()`");
}
```
To display only necessary certain values from the state, you need to write a separate crate. In this crate, specify functions that will return the desired values from the `State` struct. For example - [gear-dapps/supply-chain/state](https://github.com/gear-dapps/supply-chain/tree/master/state):

```rust
#[metawasm]
pub trait Metawasm {
    type State = <ContractMetadata as Metadata>::State;

    fn item_info(item_id: ItemId, state: Self::State) -> Option<ItemInfo> {
        state.item_info(item_id)
    }

    fn participants(state: Self::State) -> Participants {
        state.participants()
    }

    fn roles(actor: ActorId, state: Self::State) -> Vec<Role> {
        state.roles(actor)
    }

    fn existing_items(state: Self::State) -> Vec<(ItemId, ItemInfo)> {
        state.items
    }

    fn fungible_token(state: Self::State) -> ActorId {
        state.fungible_token
    }

    fn non_fungible_token(state: Self::State) -> ActorId {
        state.non_fungible_token
    }

    fn is_action_cached(actor_action: ActorIdInnerSupplyChainAction, state: Self::State) -> bool {
        let (actor, action) = actor_action;

        state.is_action_cached(actor, action)
    }
}

pub type ActorIdInnerSupplyChainAction = (ActorId, InnerAction);
```
