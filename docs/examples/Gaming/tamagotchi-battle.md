## Implementation details

### Tamagotchi Battle program description

The Tamagotchi Battle program contains the following information

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
struct Battle {
    admins: Vec<ActorId>,
    players: BTreeMap<ActorId, Player>,
    players_ids: Vec<ActorId>,
    current_players: Vec<ActorId>,
    state: BattleState,
    current_winner: ActorId,
    pairs: BTreeMap<PairId, Pair>,
    players_to_pairs: BTreeMap<ActorId, Vec<PairId>>,
    completed_games: u8,
    reservations: BTreeMap<ActorId, ReservationId>,
}
```

* `admins` - administrators, who can start the battle and each new round
* `players` - list of player parameters
* `players_ids` - the actual tamagotchi id's that are playing
* `current_players` - list of all registered tamagotchi
* `state` - current battle stage
* `current_winner` - winner of the last battle
* `pairs` - list of pair parameters
* `players_to_pairs` - matching players and their pair_ids
* `completed_games` - the number of pairs that finished the battle
* `reservations` - reservations id for delayed messages

`Player` structure looks as follows:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Player {
    pub owner: ActorId,
    pub name: String,
    pub date_of_birth: u64,
    pub tmg_id: TamagotchiId,
    pub defence: u16,
    pub power: u16,
    pub health: u16,
    pub color: String,
    pub victories: u32,
}
```
* `owner` - owner's address
* `name` - Tamagotchi name
* `date_of_birth` - Tamagotchi's birthday
* `tmg_id` - Tamagotchi id
* `defence` - level of protection
* `power` - level of power
* `health` - level of health
* `color` - tamagotchi color
* `victories` - number of victories

`Pair` structure looks as follows:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub struct Pair {
    pub owner_ids: Vec<ActorId>,
    pub tmg_ids: Vec<ActorId>,
    pub moves: Vec<Option<Move>>,
    pub rounds: u8,
    pub game_is_over: bool,
    pub winner: ActorId,
    pub move_deadline: u64,
    pub msg_id: MessageId,
}
```
* `owner_ids` - it's a Tamagotchi owner's id
* `tmg_ids` - it's a Tamagotchi id
* `moves` - history of moves
* `rounds` - current round number/number of rounds
* `game_is_over` - end-of-game identifier
* `winner` - the winner of the battle (in case there is no winner equals to zero address)
* `move_deadline` - time limit for making a move
* `msg_id` - message id for actions with delayed messages

### Action

The Tamagotchi Battle program offers the following activities:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub enum BattleAction {
    StartRegistration,
    Register {
        tmg_id: TamagotchiId,
    },
    MakeMove {
        pair_id: PairId,
        tmg_move: Move,
    },
    // the following actions are only available to the admin
    StartBattle,
    AddAdmin(ActorId),
    CheckIfMoveMade {
        pair_id: PairId,
        tmg_id: Option<TamagotchiId>,
    },
}
```

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub enum Move {
    Attack,
    Defence,
}
```

### Event

For each activity, the program responds with the following replies:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub enum BattleEvent {
    RegistrationStarted,
    Registered { tmg_id: TamagotchiId },
    MoveMade,
    GoToWaitingState,
    GameIsOver,
    InfoUpdated,
    NewGame,
    BattleStarted,
    RoundResult((PairId, u16, u16, Option<Move>, Option<Move>)),
    NewRound,
    AdminAdded,
}
```

### Logic

Before the start of the battle, it is necessary to initiate the registration process, during which the status of the game is checked and the terms of the program are determined.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
fn start_registration(&mut self) {
    assert_eq!(
        self.state,
        BattleState::GameIsOver,
        "The previous game must be over"
    );
    self.state = BattleState::Registration;
    self.current_winner = ActorId::zero();
    self.players_ids = Vec::new();
    self.completed_games = 0;
    self.players_to_pairs = BTreeMap::new();
    self.current_players = Vec::new();
    self.pairs = BTreeMap::new();
    msg::reply(BattleEvent::RegistrationStarted, 0)
        .expect("Error in sending a reply `BattleEvent::RegistrationStarted`");
}
```

After that, registration for players will be available `BattleAction::Register { tmg_id: TamagotchiId }`, where players must provide the ActorId of their Tamagotchi. The registration function performs a series of checks before including a Tamagotchi in the list of participants. Tamagotchi power and defense are randomly generated during registration.


```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
async fn register(&mut self, tmg_id: &TamagotchiId) {
    assert_eq!(
        self.state,
        BattleState::Registration,
        "The game is not in Registration stage"
    );

    assert!(
        self.players_ids.len() < MAX_PARTICIPANTS as usize,
        "Maximum number of players was reached"
    );

    if self.players_ids.contains(tmg_id) {
        panic!("This tamagotchi is already in game!");
    }
    let (owner, name, date_of_birth) = get_tmg_info(tmg_id).await;

    if owner != msg::source() {
        panic!("It is not your Tamagotchi");
    }
    if !self.players.contains_key(tmg_id) {
        let power = generate_power(*tmg_id);
        let defence = MAX_POWER - power;
    // ...
```

To start the game, the admin must send the `BattleAction::StartBattle`, where first checks will be carried out, and then there will be a split into pairs.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
fn start_battle(&mut self) {
    assert!(
        self.state == BattleState::Registration || self.state == BattleState::WaitNextRound,
        "The battle can be started from registration stage of after completing a round"
    );

    assert!(
        self.players_ids.len() > 1,
        "At least 2 players must be in the game"
    );

    if !self.admins.contains(&msg::source()) {
        panic!("Only admin can start the battle");
    }

    // Clear the state if the state is `BattleState::WaitNextRound`
    self.pairs = BTreeMap::new();
    self.players_to_pairs = BTreeMap::new();
    self.completed_games = 0;

    self.split_into_pairs();

    self.state = BattleState::GameIsOn;

    msg::reply(BattleEvent::BattleStarted, 0)
        .expect("Error in a reply `BattleEvent::BattleStarted`");
}
```

> **Important notice**: The *split_into_pairs* function uses a reserved gas delayed messaging feature `msg::send_delayed_from_reservation` designed to keep track of whether a player has made a move. If a player does not make a move in the given time, that player will be penalized and will get damage to his health.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
fn send_delayed_msg_from_rsv(
    reservation_id: ReservationId,
    pair_id: PairId,
    tmg_id: &ActorId,
) -> MessageId {
    msg::send_delayed_from_reservation(
        reservation_id,
        exec::program_id(),
        BattleAction::CheckIfMoveMade {
            pair_id,
            tmg_id: Some(*tmg_id),
        },
        0,
        TIME_FOR_MOVE + 1,
    )
    .expect("Error in sending a delayed message `BattleAction::CheckIfModeMade`")
}
```

To make a move, a player needs to send a message `BattleAction::MakeMove { pair_id: PairId, tmg_move: Move}` that contains the pair id and the move the player wants to make.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
fn make_move(&mut self, pair_id: PairId, tmg_move: Move) {
    assert_eq!(
        self.state,
        BattleState::GameIsOn,
        "The game is not in `GameIsOn` state"
    );

    let pair = self.pairs.get(&pair_id).expect("Pair does not exist");
    assert!(!pair.game_is_over, "The game for this pair is over");

    let current_turn = pair.moves.len();
    let owner = pair.owner_ids[current_turn];
    assert_eq!(owner, msg::source(), "It is not your turn!");

    let pair_ids = self
        .players_to_pairs
        .get(&msg::source())
        .expect("You have no games");
    if !pair_ids.contains(&pair_id) {
        panic!("It is not your game");
    }

    let game_is_over = self.make_move_internal(pair_id, Some(tmg_move));

    if !game_is_over {
        let msg_id = send_delayed_msg_with_gas(pair_id);
        self.pairs
            .entry(pair_id)
            .and_modify(|pair| pair.msg_id = msg_id);
    }

    reply_move_made();
}
```

After the move is repeated, the delayed messages are used for the same purpose, but in this case, a different type of delayed message is used `msg::send_with_gas_delayed`, where the gas is applied separately.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
fn send_delayed_msg_with_gas(pair_id: PairId) -> MessageId {
    msg::send_with_gas_delayed(
        exec::program_id(),
        BattleAction::CheckIfMoveMade {
            pair_id,
            tmg_id: None,
        },
        GAS_AMOUNT,
        0,
        TIME_FOR_MOVE + 1,
    )
    .expect("Error in sending a delayed message `BattleAction::CheckIfModeMade`")
}
```

After the battle and determination of the winner, the game status is switched to `BattleState::WaitNextRound`, where the winners will fight each other to determine the strongest.

### Important details
1. If after a certain number of rounds (`MAX_STEPS_IN_ROUND`), it was not possible to determine the winner, then the one with more health wins.
```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
if pair.rounds == MAX_STEPS_IN_ROUND && winner.is_none() {
    winner = if players[0].health >= players[1].health {
        players[1].health = 0;
        Some(0)
    } else {
        players[0].health = 0;
        Some(1)
    };
}
```
2. After each round, it re-generates the power and defense of the Tamagotchi.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
players[0].power = generate_power(pair.tmg_ids[0]);
players[0].defence = MAX_POWER - players[0].power;
players[1].power = generate_power(pair.tmg_ids[1]);
players[1].defence = MAX_POWER - players[1].power;
```

3. When a player makes an attack, and the other player doesn't respond, the damage accumulates for both the attacker's strike and the opponent's penalty.

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
[Some(Move::Attack), None] => {
    let player_0_power = players[0].power / 6;
    // penalty for skipping the move
    let penalty = generate_damage();
    health_loss_1 = players[1].health.saturating_sub(
        players[1]
            .health
            .saturating_sub(player_0_power)
            .saturating_sub(penalty),
    );
    players[1].health = players[1]
        .health
        .saturating_sub(player_0_power)
        .saturating_sub(penalty);
    if players[1].health == 0 {
        winner = Some(0);
    }
    (winner, health_loss_0, health_loss_1)
}
```

## Program metadata and state
Metadata interface description:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/io/src/lib.rs"
pub struct BattleMetadata;

impl Metadata for BattleMetadata {
    type Init = ();
    type Handle = InOut<BattleAction, BattleEvent>;
    type Others = ();
    type Reply = ();
    type Signal = ();
    type State = Out<Battle>;
}
```

To display the program state information, the `state()` function is used:

```rust title="tamagotchi-battle/src/lib.rs"
#[no_mangle]
extern fn state() {
    let battle = unsafe { BATTLE.take().expect("Unexpected error in taking state") };
    msg::reply(battle, 0).expect("Failed to share state");
}
```
