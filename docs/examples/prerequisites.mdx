# Gear Examples

Gear provides a set of examples that can be used for your familiarization with writing programs on Gear or become the basis for your own dApp: [https://github.com/gear-dapps](https://github.com/gear-dapps).

You can write your own smart contract or try to build from examples. Let's Rock!

## Stable environment

All smart contract examples and JS applications have been tested on a stable environment that consists of specific development tool versions necessary for implementing, building and running smart contracts and JS applications.

You may configure a local development environment according to the information provided below or use a pre-configured Docker image as described in the [Using Docker](#using-docker) section.

Current stable release: `v1.1`

:::warning Note
Windows users may encounter some problems related to the installation of Rust components and dependencies.
It is highly recommended to use Linux or macOS for compiling Gear node and smart-contracts.
:::

## First steps

To create our app project use the command **cargo**:

```bash
cargo new gear-app --lib
```

The project structure is following:

```
  └── gear-app // Your contract dir
      │
      ├── src // Source files of your program
      │    ├── maybe_some_file.rs // Additional module if needed
      │    └── lib.rs // Main file of your program
      │
      └── Cargo.toml // Manifest of your program
```

Create file `build.rs` with the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    gear_wasm_builder::build();
}
```

`Cargo.toml` is a project manifest in Rust, it contains all metadata necessary for compiling the project.
Configure the `Cargo.toml` similarly to how it is configured [ping/Cargo.toml](https://github.com/gear-dapps/ping/blob/master/Cargo.toml). You can refer to [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started-in-5-minutes.md) for additional details.

## Building Rust Contract

We should compile our smart contract in the app folder:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Our application should compile successfully and the final file `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/gear-app.wasm` should appear.

## Using Docker

You can use a pre-configured Docker image to build and test your smart contract. The image contains all the necessary tools and dependencies for building and running smart contracts and JS applications.

The source code of the image is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-dapps/gear-env).

To use the image, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can find the installation instructions for your OS on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

After installing Docker, you can pull the image from the Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/gear-dapps/gear-env:stable
```

To run the image, use the following command:

````mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux-mac" label="Linux / macOS x86_64">

```bash
docker run --rm --name gear-env -itd ghcr.io/gear-dapps/gear-env:stable bash
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="mac-arm" label="macOS ARM">

```bash
docker run --rm --name gear-env --platform linux/amd64 -itd ghcr.io/gear-dapps/gear-env:stable bash
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

The command will run the image in the background and give you access to the container's shell. You can use the following command to access the container's shell:

```bash
docker exec -it gear-env bash
```

Copy a smart contract to be built to the container (here we use the `gear-app` created above):

```bash
docker cp ./gear-app gear-env:/root
```

After that, you can build the smart contract:

```bash
docker exec -itw /root/gear-app gear-env cargo build --release
```

The compiled smart contract will be available in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release` folder inside the container. Copy it to your local machine:

```bash
docker cp gear-env:/root/gear-app/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/. ./
```

Stop the Docker container after using:

```shell
docker stop gear-env
```
