Vara Network can be considered mostly as a test-bed for optimizations and experiments. It will have the utility of a single-chain, high-performance network. Once it is live, it will live forever and will never lose any user data.
It will have very little governance.

The main features of VARA network are:

- Fastest truly decentralized L1 ever
- Testbed for new features and optimizations
- Stable and upgradable network thanks to Substrate
- Little to no governance

Many next-generation apps, like gaming and payments, require low latency execution. The Vara standalone network will provide the fastest on-ramp for these applications and will unlock new potential applications.
