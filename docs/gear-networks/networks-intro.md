Three blockchain networks powered by Gear Protocol are planned to be launched:
- **Vara** - Standalone Layer-1 network
- **Geira** - L2 Kusama Parachain
- **Sula** - L2 Polkadot Parachain

Gearâ€™s 3-network ecosystem gives app developers ultimate access to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems while optimizing the performance and security of their app. It allows any existing or innovative dApp to be deployed from any Web3 or Web2 ecosystem. Each network is a general purpose smart contract platform capable of running any category of applications.

Each network has unique performance and security parameters that will likely be suitable for unique use cases:
- **Vara** is characterized by the highest performance, lowest latency and is the most upgradeable, but will have its own set of validators. Gaming, payments and experimental use cases will likely be best suited for Vara.
- **Geira** assumes the performance and security parameters of Kusama. Most NFT projects launch on Kusama.
- **Sula** assumes the performance and security parameters of Polkadot. Most DeFi apps and TVL tend to concentrate on DOT dApps.

## Cross-network interoperability

We will partner with third party bridges to enable interoperability between the three networks, connecting them to the entirety of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Assets and applications will be able to bridge between networks as messages.

This gives application developers real-time decision-making ability on where to launch based on parameter optimization. It also allows dApp developers to deploy once and gain access to the full ecosystem.
