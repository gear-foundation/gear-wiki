## Overview

Welcome to Gear network documentation portal. The central source for everyone looking for guides and developer's documentation in the Gear ecosystem. While our project is developing and growing, it is a modern knowledge base at the moment. Contributions are welcome!

Our Wiki describes a general technology overview, the key advantages of Gear’s technology, helps to get started with Gear node setup and uploading your smart contracts, provides full API details and examples.

## What is Gear?

Gear is a Substrate-based smart-contract platform allowing anyone to run dApp in a few minutes.

 - Gear provides Layer-1 decentralized network as the easiest and most cost-effective way to run WebAssembly programs (smart-contracts) compiled from many popular languages, such as Rust, C/C++ and more.

 - Gear ensures very minimal, intuitive, and sufficient API for running both newly written and existing programs on multiple networks without the need to rewrite them. Smart Contracts are stored in the blockchain’s state and are invoked preserving their state upon request.

  - Gear is intended to be a Layer-2 parachain for hosting smart contracts on the Polkadot/Kusama network. This allows anyone to deploy any dApp on Polkadot and Kusama to take advantage of all the benefits of their ecosystems, yet at the minimal financial expense. Also, refer to the [Ecosystem](/ecosystem/polkadot.md) chapter for more details about Polkadot and layers definition.

 - GEAR enables a seamless transition to Web3, enabling the running of dApps, microservices, middleware and open APIs.

Gear uses a Substrate framework. This simplifies the creation of different blockchains for specific applications. Substrate provides extensive functionality out-of-the-box and allows one to focus on creating a custom engine on top of the protocol.

Launching a blockchain has previously been expensive. It required significant efforts for building a transactions application, a distributed ledger, a consensus mechanism, a virtual machine and more. But Gear allows dApp developers to focus on their projects rather than building and operating an entire blockchain from scratch.
