Welcome to Gear’s documentation portal. This is a central source of information for everyone looking for important information, guides and developer's documentation about Gear.

Our Wiki outlines foundational information required, general technology overviews, the key advantages of Gear’s technology, help to get started with Gear node setup, how to upload your smart contracts, while also providing full API details and examples.

All code, libraries, and tools are available on Github with a permissive Apache-2.0 license. Feel free to use the tools and libraries, log issues as you find them, or create pull requests for your bug-bears or features.

As our project is developing and growing, contributions are more than welcome!

## What is Gear Protocol?

Gear Protocol is a Substrate-based smart-contract platform that enables anyone to deploy a dApp in a matter of minutes. Gear Protocol is the most cost-effective way to run smart contracts that have been compiled from many popular programming languages, such as Rust, C, C++ and many more. It ensures very minimal, intuitive and sufficient API for running both newly written and existing programs on multiple networks without having to rewrite them. Smart contracts are stored in the blockchain’s state and are invoked, preserving their state upon request.

Powered by Gear Protocol, Gear Networks are planning on becoming a parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama networks to host smart contracts on these respective networks. This will mean that by deploying on Gear Network, developers would be able to take advantage of all the benefits of the Polkadot and Kusama networks and [ecosystems](/ecosystem/polkadot.md) at minimal cost.

Gear Protocol will assist with the transition to mass use of Web3 technologies by enabling the running of innovative dApps, microservices, middleware and open APIs.
