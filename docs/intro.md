## Overview

Welcome to Gear network documentation portal. The central source for everyone looking for guides and developer's documentation in the Gear ecosystem. While our project is developing and growing, it is a modern knowledge base at the moment. Contributions are welcome!

Our Wiki describes a general technology overview, the key advantages of Gear’s technology, helps to get started with Gear node setup and uploading your smart contracts, provides full API details and examples.

## What is Gear?

Today Polkadot is one of the fastest-growing multi-chain networks. Although it has an adaptive architecture for building smart-contract platforms and rapid technology development for decentralized applications, it is not a smart contract platform by itself.

Gear is a Polkadot/Kusama parachain network that is intended to be a tool for hosting L2 smart contracts. This allows anyone to deploy any dApp on Polkadot and Kusama to take advantage of all the benefits of their ecosystems, yet at the minimal financial expense.

Like Polkadot, Gear uses a Substrate framework. This simplifies the creation of different blockchains for specific applications. Substrate provides extensive functionality out-of-the-box and allows one to focus on creating a custom engine on top of the protocol.

Launching a blockchain has previously been expensive, but Gear allows dApp developers to focus on their projects rather than building and operating an entire blockchain from scratch.

The central aspect of Polkadot is its ability to route arbitrary messages between chains. Both Polkadot and Gear networks speak the same language — asynchronous messages — so all the projects built using Gear easily integrate into the Polkadot and Kusama networks. The asynchronous messaging architecture allows Gear to be an efficient and easy-to-use parachain.

Projects building on Gear can seamlessly integrate their solutions into the whole Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.
