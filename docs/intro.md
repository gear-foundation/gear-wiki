Welcome to Gear’s documentation portal. This is the primary source of information for everyone who is looking for detailed information about Gear. Here you will find guides and developer's documentation that will enable you to dive deeper into developing programs and smart contracts in a decentralized manner on the Gear Protocol.

This Wiki outlines foundational information required, general technology overviews and key advantages of Gear’s technology, including how to implement and run your programs and how to get started with the Gear node setup, while also providing full API details and examples.

All code, libraries, and tools are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/gear-tech/gear). Feel free to use the tools and libraries, log issues as you find them, or create pull requests for your bug-bears or features.

As the Gear Protocol is developing and growing, contributions are more than welcome!

## What is the Gear Protocol?

The Gear Protocol is a [Substrate](https://substrate.io/)-based programing platform that enables anyone to develop and run a dApp in a matter of minutes. The Gear Protocol is the most developer-friendly and cost-effective way to implement and run programs and smart contracts with arbitrary logic and of any complexity. Gear programs run under [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) VM and they can be compiled from many popular programming languages, such as Rust, C, C++ and many more.

The protocol ensures very minimal, intuitive and sufficient APIs for implementing programs and running them on multiple networks without having to rewrite them. From a technological point of view, the Gear Protocol is distinguished by fundamentally new features that enable you to create asynchronous programs with a completely new and previously unattainable user experience, namely - the Actor model for communication, the persistent memory concept and WebAssembly execution environment. The protocol dictates what actors should look like as communicating entities.

The Gear Protocol will assist with the transition to mass use of Web3 technologies by enabling the running of innovative dApps, microservices, middleware and open APIs.

## What is the Gear Network?

Powered by the Gear Protocol, Gear Networks can represent a wide range of forms - including the ability to build standalone next-generation [Layer-1](https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-layer-1-and-layer-2-blockchain-scaling-solutions-7104877) networks, launch [Layer-2](https://www.investopedia.com/what-are-layer-1-and-layer-2-blockchain-scaling-solutions-7104877) solutions to perform heavy computations outside of any main network, launch parachains in the [DotSama](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/dotsama) ecosystem, use the Gear node to run microservices, combine nodes into a custom network and more.

By deploying on Gear Protocol, network developers can fully leverage the benefits offered by Gear.

**[Vara Network](https://vara.network/)** is the first stand-alone Layer-1 decentralized network built and running on top of Gear Protocol.
